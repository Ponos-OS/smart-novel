# Self-improvement log

## B1 - 2026-10-29

- `REQUIREMENTS.md` said not to commit each step; the user later asked for B1 to be committed explicitly, so it was committed on request.
- The repo has no `prisma/migrations` (it uses `db push`), and Prisma cannot express the partial unique index for `is_default`; B2 must enforce a single default in a transaction.
- `nx e2e backend-e2e` could not run: the frontend image build failed because `frontend:build` depends on `codegen`, which needs `apps/backend/schema.gql`, absent from the image. It failed independently of the B1 diff (introduced by `5edbd58`). B1 is verified by unit tests, lint and typecheck only.
- A Monitor waiting on `pgrep -f "nx e2e ..."` never fired because pgrep matched the monitor's own command line; the run had already finished.

## B2 - 2026-10-29

- Left uncommitted on request, for review.
- `nx e2e backend-e2e` still blocked by the frontend image build (see B1), so the new `license.e2e-spec.ts` is typechecked and linted but not run. Substitute used: a throwaway `postgres:17.11` container, `prisma db push`, the real seed, and a temporary script driving `LicenseService` (deleted afterwards). It caught a real race that the mocked unit tests could not: concurrent `upsert` of the same new text hit a `text_hash` unique violation.
- A step with raw SQL or concurrency behaviour needs a real-Postgres check even when e2e is available, mocks cannot show it.
